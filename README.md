Meeb was created as a part of the Data-Enabled Design course at the Eindhoven University of Technology by Myrte van Dongen, Lianne de Jong and Lei Nelissen. 

## Repository
Meeb consists of:
* An in-home sensor module
* A set of applications for
    * Climate control
    * A Dashboard
* A data backend

These aspects are gathered in this repository but are split out among different folders, since the respective technologies differ greatly.
